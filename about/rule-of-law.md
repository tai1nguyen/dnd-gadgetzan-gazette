## General Rule Of Law
![Gavel](../references/images/gavel.jpg =200x){.float-right}
Gadgetzan is no village led by hidebound hierarchs or petty fiefdom ruled by the whim of a warlord. It is a city of laws molded by the spirit of justice. As a rule, you can trust members of the City Watch to do their duty diligently, and you can expect that the city's magisters will be fair. If you have cause to come before the Masked Lords or the Open Lords themselves, rest assured that if your cause be just, justice will be done. If, however, you find yourself in the wrong, know that though it might take time to weigh that wrong, the hammer of justice will fall- and it will be wielded by Gadgetzan with a vengeance.

Individuals accustomed to the rough-and-tumble life in much of the North are often surprised by the fact that Gedgetzans go about unarmed and unarmored. Yet Gadgetzan doesn't have any law that forbids carrying weapons or armor. Instead, it has a culture ofcivility that makes such behavior unnecessary.

Businesses and individuals do employ armed guards, but except for nobles or foreign envoys, few people travel about the city with such protection. As such, the sight of armed and armored individuals walking the streets who aren't in the livery of the city or one of its noble houses inspires caution in most Gadgetzans. Folk assume that you wouldn't bother lugging around such equipment unless you either intend violence or expect that it might soon be visited upon you.

### The Watchful Order of Magists

Expect to be questioned at the gate, or when you register with a magister, regarding your ability to cast arcane magic. Wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane spellcasters who intend to stay in Gadgetzan for any length of time are required to register with the city, and will be strongly encouraged to join the Watchful Order of Magists, headed by the Blackstaff.

Members of the Watchful Order are expected to render service to the city when called upon, acting as temporary members of the City Watch. Their expertise often helps investigators determine whether magic was used to commit a crime in the city. Members can also expect to be tapped for assistance during and after fires, natural events that cause multiple casualties, or other nonmagical disasters.

Members of the Watchful Order form a more or less sociable association in the city, working together to
keep an eye on any spellcasters who opt not to join their guild.

### City Watch
You can recognize any member of the City Watch by the uniform: a red-and-goldenrod doublet and a tall steel helmet. Each typically carries a long truncheon, a shortshord, and a buckler. Because most citizens in Gadgetzan don't bear weapons, these tools prove a more than ample deterrent to criminal activity. Members of the Watch typically don't carry crossbows or other weapons to attack at range, but running from the Watch -though it may be a time-honored tradition for local miscreants- rarely works out for newcomers to the city.

The Watch know the streets they patrol and that area's residents better than you do, even if you stay in Gadgetzan for ten seasons.

The City Watch has watch posts throughout the city. These stations are often off the main thoroughfares, tucked away in small courtyards or at cross streets. A watch post can be recognized by the red-and-gold lantern outside it, lit even during the day with a continual flame spell. A watch post serves as an organizational headquarters and armory. Anyone who wishes to report a crime may do so at a watch post in the event a Watch constable can't be found elsewhere. A watch post typically contains a few holding cells where people arrested for crimes can be detained until they're marched to a courthouse jail before standing trial.

Small squads head out from the watch posts on daily and nightly rounds of the city streets, or on special assignments involving protection or investigation.

## Corruption
Like any other city, crime is a common occurance in the day to day life of the city. Unlike other cities, Gadgetzan's recent boom in economic wealth have also brought with it an increase in criminal activities.

As more bad actors make a presence on the streets, the corrupting force they exude have begun to affect the once noble City Watch and Watchful Order. There have been whispers of some members known to look the other way to balanant abuses of the law for a quick coin.
